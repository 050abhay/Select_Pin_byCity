<p>In this web page, there are two input boxes. The first box allows users to input the<b> name of a city</b>, while the second box is for <b>entering a pin code</b>. However, the real magic happens when a city is selected from the first input box. As soon as a city is chosen, the second input box dynamically updates to display all the pin codes associated with that city. This feature ensures a seamless experience for users, as they no longer need to manually search for pin codes once they've selected their desired city.</p>
